Game Choice: I chose to make this game because I thought it was a fun and simple way to understand how games using 
coordinate systems can be programmed in terms of user interface and data storage (e.g. grid position changes), 
and how computer prediction can be implemented at a basic level. Given the different modes the game's form can take, 
I was also curious how this would affect computer prediction, would there need to be different versions of computer 
prediction at each game mode?

	2 hours - Deciding what game to program, what game modes to include, what kind of players to include 
	to include in the game (PvP, PvE), what kind of user interface (UI) to have at the menu and at each round. Then, researching what 
	all these areas of the game would need to include in their design prior to programming (i.e. what they would need to have to 
	be able to accurately portray the game, and their corresponding modes).

November 16, 2020: 

	5.5 hours: Implemented user input for game mode, environment type for PvP and setting up a "player" class for easier manipulation of player moves, grid positions, board-size,
	showGrid() function to display a player's size-determined-grid on screen given a player's ship placement coordinates on their own grid, and solving edge cases 
	so that inputs have to be correct. Started getShipCoords function (1/3 completed with some code and all planning).

	5 hours: Finished the getShipCoords function where it handles boat placements that are only either horizontal or vertical, but doesn't allow for diagonal placements
	or placements that are less than or greater than the boat lengths given for each boat. Handled incorrect inputs such as overlapping boat placements as well.

	2.5 hours: Implemented player turn based attack function ( attackCoord() ) in classic mode and its subsequent handling of valid inputs for a attack coordinate, 
	tweaked getShipCoords() to record a player's ship placement coordinates on their own position grid for future game modes.

November 23, 2020:
	
	1.5 hour: Finished classic mode for PvP, ensuring that players can place their ships, attack each other based on turn based inputs, and lastly finished the win 
	condition for both human players.
