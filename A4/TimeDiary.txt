Game Choice: I chose to make this game because I thought it was a fun and simple way to understand how games using 
coordinate systems can be programmed in terms of user interface and data storage, and how computer prediction can 
can be implemented at a basic level. Given the different modes the game's form can take, I was also curious how this
would affect computer prediction, would there need to be different versions of computer prediction at each 
game mode?

November 9, 2020: 2 hours - Deciding what game to program, what game modes to include, what kind of players to include 
to include in the game (PvP, PvE), what kind of user interface (UI) to have at the menu and at each round. Then, researching what 
all these areas of the game would need to include in their design prior to programming (i.e. what they would need to have to 
be able to accurately portray the game, and their corresponding modes).

	6 hours: Implementing user input for game mode, environemnt type and board-size, setting up a "player" class for easier manipulation of player moves and scoring,
	and constructing a function to display a player determined grid on screen for player's ship placement before/during game play.
