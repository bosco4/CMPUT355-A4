5.) Chosen Game: BattleShip
Description: It is a game where 2 players place 5 battle ships on a grid (with each ship 
consuming a different number of spaces on the grid), and then attacking each other's battle ships by alternating turns to guess 
a coordinate on the grid (simulating missles being fired at that grid position) as to where their opponent's battle ships could be 
at an attempt to sink a battle ship. The winner is determined when a player has destroyed all of their opponent's battleships.

6.) Original Goals: Implement Player vs Player (PvP), Player vs Environment/Computer (PvE), and different versions of battle ship 
such as Classic, Salvo, RealTime. For PvP the goal is to just have a running version of the game where each player shares a computer, 
places their ships in secret, and attacks each other through the grid system. For placing of the ships, and attacking, each player 
should be able to see two grids; a grid containing their own battle ships (showing ONLY the condition of the ships, i.e. which have parts haven been attacked), 
and a grid containing launched attacks to their opponents (showing only "successful attacks" and "missed attacks"). For PvE the goal is to have the 
same gaming system implemented in PvP, but with the goal of having three difficulties (easy, normal, hard). The computer
difficulty should be dictated by having the computer increasingly be better at guessing ship coordinates (getting closer and closer
to human guessing ?).
